gh repo view --json parent
```

Look for:
- Original repository URL

```

**In `NOTICE`:**
```markdown
Line 6:  [Original Project Name]
Line 7:  [original-author]/[original-repo]
Line 11: [Year] [Original Author Name]
```

### Step 3: Review and Commit

```bash
# Check changes
git status

# Add files
git add docs/ATTRIBUTION.md docs/ATTRIBUTION_CHECKLIST.md \
        docs/ATTRIBUTION_BEST_PRACTICES.md NOTICE README.md

## Attribution Model Used

We chose **"Inspired By" model** because:

### Code Breakdown:
- **Original Code**: ~5-10%
  - Basic MT5 connection
  - Simple order execution (modified)
  - Initial structure (reorganized)

- **Your New Code**: ~90-95%
  - All ML code
  - All ICT strategy
  - All dual orders
  - All breakeven logic
  - All architecture improvements
  - All plugins/events/extensions
  - All testing
  - All documentation

### This Justifies:
- ✅ Your name as primary author
- ✅ "Inspired by" rather than "Fork"
- ✅ Prominent "your project" positioning
- ✅ Still giving credit to original

---

## Example: How It Looks

### In README.md (Top):
```markdown
> 📜 **ATTRIBUTION**: This project was initially forked from an 
> original MT5-SuperTrend bot and has been significantly enhanced 
> with ML, ICT strategies, dual orders, and advanced architecture. 
> See [ATTRIBUTION.md](docs/ATTRIBUTION.md) for full credits.
```

### In Documentation Section:
```markdown
### Getting Started
- 📜 [Attribution & Credits](docs/ATTRIBUTION.md) - 
  **Project history and original author credits**
```

### Users Will See:
1. Clear notice that original author exists
2. Easy link to full details
3. Transparency about modifications
4. Professional attribution handling

---

## If Original Author Contacts You

### Scenario 1: Positive Response 😊
```
"Thanks for the credit! Love what you've done!"

→ Response:
- Thank them enthusiastically
- Offer to collaborate
- Share improvements if useful
- Build long-term relationship
```

### Scenario 2: Neutral Response 😐
```

```

### Scenario 3: Negative Response 😠
```
"I'm not happy with this fork."

```
