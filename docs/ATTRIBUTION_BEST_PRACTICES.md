```

### 2. Clear Differentiation
```markdown
‚úÖ Listed original features
‚úÖ Listed our modifications (90%+ new code)
‚úÖ Explained evolution of project
‚úÖ Quantified contributions
```

### 3. Legal Compliance
```markdown
‚úÖ Included MIT license text

‚úÖ Provided source attribution
```

### 4. Transparency
```markdown
‚úÖ Honest about origins

‚úÖ Made info easy to find
```

## Attribution Models for Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Minimal Fork (10-30% Changes)
```markdown
# MyProject

> **Forked from [Original Project](URL)** by [Author]
> 
> This is a fork with the following enhancements:
> - Feature A
> - Feature B
> - Bug fixes

See original project for core functionality.
```

### Scenario 2: Significant Fork (30-70% Changes)
```markdown
# MyProject

> **Based on [Original Project](URL)** by [Author]
> 
> This project has been significantly enhanced with:
> - Major feature X
> - Complete rewrite of Y
> - New architecture Z
>
> See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) for details.
```

### Scenario 3: Inspired By (70%+ New Code) ‚úÖ **OUR CASE**
```markdown
# MyProject

> **Initially inspired by [Original Project](URL)** by [Author]
> 
> This is a substantial evolution with 90%+ new code:
> - Complete ML integration
> - New trading strategies  
> - Advanced architecture
>
> See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) for full history.
```

### Scenario 4: Complete Rewrite (95%+ New Code)
```markdown

> **Concept inspired by [Original Project](URL)** by [Author]
>
> This is an independent implementation with:
> - Different technology stack
> - Different architecture
> - Different features
>
> Original project served as conceptual inspiration only.
```

git commit -m "docs: Add attribution for original project"
```

### 3. Tag Releases
```bash
# Tag when you fork
git tag -a v0.1.0-forked -m "Initial fork from [Original]"

# Tag your versions
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First major release with ML features"
```
