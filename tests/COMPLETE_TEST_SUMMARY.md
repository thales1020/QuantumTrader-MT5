## ⚠️ Critical Validations

### Dual Orders Strategy ✅
```
Each trading signal opens 2 orders:
  Order 1: RR 1:1 (quick profit)
  Order 2: RR 3:1 (main profit)
  
Total Risk = risk_percent × 2

Example:
  Config: risk_percent = 1.0%
  Actual Total Risk = 2.0% (1.0% × 2 orders)

For 1% total risk → Set risk_percent = 0.5%
```

### Safety Limits ✅
```
Daily Loss Limit:        5% of starting balance
Max Drawdown:            15% from peak
Consecutive Losses:      5 trades
Margin Level Min:        200%
Trading Hours:           08:00 - 22:00 UTC
Max Positions:           3 concurrent
```

### Emergency Stop Triggers ✅
```
Any of these stops trading immediately:
  ✓ Daily loss exceeded (>5%)
  ✓ Max drawdown exceeded (>15%)
  ✓ Consecutive losses hit (≥5)
  ✓ Margin call warning (<200%)
  ✓ MT5 connection lost
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Works ✅
```
1. Dual orders strategy (1:1 + 3:1) provides:
   - Quick profit taking
   - Larger profit potential
   - Better overall performance

2. M5 timeframe optimal for ICT SMC Bot:
   - Good signal frequency
   - Acceptable quality distribution
   - Proven profitable on 6/8 symbols

3. RR 3:1 ratio works well:
   - Compensates for lower win rate (27-32%)
   - Positive profit factor (1.06-1.32)
   - Sustainable long-term

4. Custom ICT implementation:
   - No dependency on buggy SMC library
   - Full control over logic
   - Reliable performance
```

### What to Avoid ❌
```
1. XAU (Gold):
   - High volatility
   - Lower win rate (24%)
   - Largest drawdown (62%)
   - Consistent losses (-$4,388)

2. NZDUSD:
   - Poor performance (-$3,656)
   - High drawdown (47%)
   - Lower win rate (23%)

3. M15 timeframe for SuperTrend:
   - Poor overall performance
   - Average PF 0.96 (losing)
   - Only 2/7 symbols profitable
   - H1/H4 recommended instead
```

### Best Practices 📖
```
1. Risk Management:
   - Remember dual orders = 2x risk
   - Keep total risk <5% per symbol
   - Respect daily loss limits

2. Symbol Selection:
   - Start with proven performers
   - Monitor new symbols carefully
   - Disable consistent losers

3. Monitoring:
   - First 24h: Watch closely
   - Check dual orders execute correctly
   - Verify all safety limits work
   - Review logs regularly

4. Configuration:
   - Start conservative (0.5% risk)
   - Increase gradually if profitable
   - Never exceed risk tolerance
```

## 🔒 Risk Warnings

### Important Reminders ⚠️
```
1. DUAL ORDERS DOUBLE RISK
   Config risk_percent: 1.0%
   Actual total risk: 2.0%
   
   For 1% total → use risk_percent: 0.5%

2. BACKTEST ≠ LIVE PERFORMANCE
   - Backtest assumes perfect execution
   - Real trading has slippage
   - Spread varies (especially news events)
   - Network delays possible

3. DEMO FIRST, ALWAYS
   - Test thoroughly on demo
   - Validate dual orders work
   - Check all symbols perform
   - Confirm safety stops trigger
   
4. MONITOR ACTIVELY
   - Don't set and forget
   - Check logs daily
   - Review performance weekly
   - Adjust as needed

5. RESPECT LIMITS
   - Daily loss limit: HARD STOP
   - Max drawdown: HARD STOP
   - Consecutive losses: HARD STOP
   - These protect your capital
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Tests fail on import**
```powershell
# Fix: Add project root to path
$env:PYTHONPATH = "c:\github\ML-SuperTrend-MT5"
python run_tests.py
```

**Q: SMC library encoding error**
```
This is expected. SMC library has a bug.
We use custom implementation instead.
Tests skip SMC-dependent tests.
```

**Q: MT5 connection fails in tests**
```
Tests use mocks, don't need real MT5.
Manual testing with MT5 required before live.
```

**Q: Dual orders not working**
```
Check:
1. open_position() creates 2 orders
2. Both have same volume
3. Different TPs (1:1 and configured RR)
4. Comments show RR1 and RR2
```
