## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def calculate_position_size(
    balance: float, 
    risk_percent: float, 
    stop_loss_pips: float
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate position size based on account risk.
    
    Args:
        balance: Account balance in base currency
        risk_percent: Risk percentage per trade
        stop_loss_pips: Stop loss distance in pips
        
    Returns:
        Position size in lots
    """
    risk_amount = balance * (risk_percent / 100)
    position_size = risk_amount / (stop_loss_pips * 10)
    return round(position_size, 2)
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Testing

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use meaningful test names

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update docstrings for any modified functions
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation clear and concise
